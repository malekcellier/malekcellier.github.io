**Hi!**

I'm Malek, a ``Senior Software Engineer`` with over 20 years of R&D experience in the telecom industry focusing on ``Radio Resource Management``, I have developed strong problem-solving skills and domain knowledge. I leverage these to design, implement, and evaluate algorithms resulting in better-performing products. My work in that area has resulted in publications, 3GPP contributions, IPRs and patents.

With a solid grounding in Linux, I thrive on crafting and architecting systems. I've developed an array of simulation tools across languages such as Python, OpenGL, C/C++, and MATLAB, all while implementing leading DevOps methodologies. My expertise in software engineering has continually deepened throughout the years and encompasses shell/Python scripting, web frontend/backend, network/socket programming, graphics card programming, multiprocessing/threading programming.

In short:

- ``Background``: I have worked for companies like Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei designing and implementing algorithms to improve Radio Resource Management (RRM) for 3G, 4G, 5G
- ``Interests``: I have specialized in building and using simulation tools and platforms in Python, C++, WebGl, OpenGL. I have built simulation engines, OpenGL renderer for data processing
- ``DevOps``: I have helped teams migrate to using git, GitLab, and Docker...hence reaping the benefits of the DevOps philosophy
- ``Contact``: If you want to get in touch, contact me here or through LinkedIn.

Cheers

Malek Cellier
