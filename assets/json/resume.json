self-organized networks","publisher":"IEEE","releaseDate":"2017-09-14","summary":"Increasing spectral and energy efficiency in future networks requires flexible and timely allocation of radio resources along multiple dimensions including frequency, time and space. Although this multi-dimensionality offers additional degrees of freedom, it however comes at the cost of higher complexity. To this end, it is envisaged that spatial information associated with user resource allocation will provide a means for an efficient utilization of a dense radio access network (RAN) infrastructure in a proactive and self-optimized manner. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims at the utilization of multi-dimensional (MD) radio service maps (RSM) for storing and exploiting position-based information. Requirements, key concepts and functions are described. The potential gains in energy consumption and efficiency of the radio service maps are shown by means of numerical results for an ultra-dense network deployment scenario.","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8031530"},{"name":"Enhancing Uplink Performance in UTRAN LTE networks by Load Adaptive Power Control","publisher":"ETT21","releaseDate":"2010-06-22","summary":"Uplink power control in 3GPP UTRAN long term evolution (LTE) networks consists of a closed-loop scheme around an open-loop point of operation. The uplink performance of the network is decisively influenced by power control. This paper provides insight into the uplink power control procedure and its interworking with adaptive transmission bandwidth (ATB) as well as adaptive modulation and coding (AMC). A detailed performance evaluation is presented based on system level simulations. In the first step, the performance of pure open-loop power control (OLPC) was analysed and the impact of parameter settings on resource allocation, utilisation of specific modulation and coding schemes (MCS), re-transmission rate, and resulting throughput was determined. A two-dimensional parameter optimisation for full path-loss (PL) compensation and fractional power control (FPC) was performed to conclude the best strategy for the trade-off between network capacity and coverage. In the second step, the impact of traffic load on the interaction between the different LTE radio resource management algorithms was analysed. A novel strategy is presented which introduces traffic load dependent decisions for the closed-loop power control (CLPC) component to optimise the uplink throughput. This solution provides an automatic configuration for LTE networks without further intervention by the operator.","url":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.1426/abstract"},{"name":"Load Adaptive Power Control in LTE Uplink","publisher":"IEEE European Wireless 2010","releaseDate":"2010-04-15","summary":"In LTE Uplink, the slow varying pathgain and shadowing are compensated by the standardized open loop power control (OLPC) which is based on a power density offset and a compensating factor for the pathloss experienced by the users. The optimization of those parameters reveals a dependency on the allocated bandwidth. A Load Adaptive Power Control (LAPC) algorithm is proposed to handle the bandwidth variations and ensure optimal system performance. In this contribution it is shown that using closed loop power control commands to adapt the transmission power density to the used bandwidth, it is possible to achieve coverage gains up to 60% while maintaining a cell throughput comparable to the reference case.","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=5483432"},{"name":"Interference Based Power Control in LTE Uplink","publisher":"IEEE ISWCS 2008","releaseDate":"2008-10-24","summary":"In LTE uplink, the slow varying path gain and shadowing are compensated by the standardized open loop power control (OLPC). Further optimization of the system performance can be done via closed loop power control commands. In this contribution, it is shown that using such commands to control the interference caused by users to the system, it is possible to achieve a gain in the order of 20% on the average cell throughput while maintaining the same outage cell throughput compared to the performance of the OLPC. Furthermore, gain on both average and outage cell throughput can be achieved by tuning the parameters of the proposed scheme.","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4726146"},{"name":"Errors on the HSUPA E-HICH Channel and their Effect on System Performance","publisher":"IEEE VTC Spring 2007","releaseDate":"2007-04-25","summary":"The E-HICH is a downlink control channel associated to the HARQ procedure in HSUPA. It allows the MAC-e entity in the NodeB to signal the correct or incorrect reception of a given MAC-e PDU by transmitting ACKs or NACKs. Errors on this channel can cause misinterpretations and impact the overall system performance. This paper looks at the performance impact caused by two types of errors: ACK misinterpreted as NACK and vice versa. Detailed user and system performance results versus the error levels on the E-HICH are provided for both cases. A2N errors cause a direct degradation of the user throughput that increases with the probability. N2A errors have a more intricate impact that leads to opposite effects. On the one hand, it causes the level of RLC retransmissions to increase. On the other hand, the missing PDUs change the HARQ operating point which will then decrease the RLC retransmission level. The overall consequence is a lowered cell and user throughput for lowly loaded networks, whereas it is almost imperceptible in fully loaded networks.","url":"http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=4212632"},{"name":"High Speed Uplink Packet Access Evaluation by Dynamic Network Simulations","publisher":"IEEE PIMRC 2006","releaseDate":"2006-09-14","summary":"High speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) improves the cell throughput by faster scheduling, L1 HARQ and enhanced bit rates.

The investigations are carried out using a real-time emulation platform, and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) with and without Selective Acknowledgement/Forward Acknowledgment (SACK/FACK) options. The results show that out-of-sequence delivery has a negative impact at higher bandwidths and TCP FACK exacerbates the problem. This is mainly due to the aggressive retransmission strategy employed by FACK, which considers the gaps in a SACK report caused by reordering as lost segments and retransmits them immediately.","url":"http://vbn.aau.dk/da/publications/the-impact-of-rlc-delivery-sequence-on-ftp-performance-in-umts(ca1ffe30-9c2c-11db-8ed6-000ea68e967b).html"},{"name":"RESPECT: A Real Time Emulator for Service Performance Evaluation in Cellular neTworks","publisher":"IEEE VTC Fall 2005","releaseDate":"2005-09-28","summary":"The evaluation and optimization of packet service performance in wireless networks is a complex process, considering the number of heterogeneous entities and protocols that are involved.
